Project plan for next 2 weeks:
- Doing research on various technologies related to implement this project
- Gathering all the requirements and getting it approved by the professor/TAs
- Doing initial phase analysis on human action recognition
- Collecting data pertaining to human actions and splitting it into training/test data
